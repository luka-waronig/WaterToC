    "Please see supplementary_appendix.pdf for more details on the system's mean field approximation and derivation of (interior) fixed point equilibria. This corresponds to the findings from Weitz et al (2016) regarding the interior fixed point $(x*, n*) = (\\frac{1}{1+\\theta}, \\frac{1}{2})$, however the derivation steps are different and environmental quality $n$ is shown to always go to $\\frac{1}{2}$ if assuming symmetric payoffs $A_0$=[T  P ; R  S] --> $A_1$=[R  S ; T  P].\n",

    "### The Initial Chapter (UvA)\n",
    "The first experimental chapter with this ABM, conducted at the University of Amsterdam, concluded with findings that fixed point attractors drive the time series of $x$ and $n$ to stabilize at the region of a median $x*$ ~ 0.72 and $n*$ ~ 0.38 in most runs of the experiment simulations, notably deviating from theoretical predictions. The mean field approximation cannot capture this co-evolution in the same way because it misses the stochastic and spatial elements, which this ABM implements, leading to different dynamics. Our paper documents the entire methodology, implementation, and analysis in detail. Below we present a report of the main experiments that were conducted, their results, and what further steps these results imply.\n",
